pgRouting Algorithms
===============================================================================

pgRouting was first called *pgDijkstra*, because it implemented only shortest path search with *Dijkstra* algorithm.
Later other functions were added and the library was renamed.

This chapter will explain selected pgRouting algorithms and which attributes are required and do some exercises.

.. Note:: This chapter uses the data from :ref:`topology`

* :ref:`dijkstra`

  * :ref:`d-1` Single Pedestrian Routing.
  * :ref:`d-2` Many Pedestrians going to the same destination.
  * :ref:`d-3`  Many Pedestrians going departing from the same location.
  * :ref:`d-4`  Many Pedestrians going to different destinations.


* :ref:`dijkstraCost`

  * :ref:`d-5`  Many Pedestrians going to different destinations interested only on the aggregate cost.

* :ref:`astar`

  * :ref:`d-6` Single Pedestrian Routing.

.. _dijkstra:

Shortest Path Dijkstra
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dijkstra algorithm was the first algorithm implemented in pgRouting. It doesn't require other attributes than ``id``, ``source`` and ``target`` ID and ``cost``.
Optionally a ``reverse_cost`` attribute can be added.
You can specify when to consider the graph as `directed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph>`_ or undirected.

.. rubric:: Signature Summary


.. code-block:: none

    pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vid)
    pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vid,  directed:=true)
    pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vid,  end_vids, directed:=true)
    pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vid,  directed:=true)
    pgr_dijkstra(edges_sql, start_vids, end_vids, directed:=true)

    RETURNS SET OF (seq, path_seq [, start_vid] [, end_vid], node, edge, cost, agg_cost)
        OR EMPTY SET

Description of the parameters can be found in `pgr_dijkstra <http://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/src/dijkstra/doc/pgr_dijkstra.html#description-of-the-signatures>`_

.. note::

    * Many pgRouting functions have ``sql::text`` as one of their arguments. While this may look confusing at first, it makes the functions very flexible as the user can pass any ``SELECT`` statement as function argument as long as the returned result contains the required number of attributes and the correct attribute names.
    * Most of pgRouting implemeted algorithms do not require the network geometry.
    * Most of pgRouting functions do not return a geometry, but only an ordered list of nodes.


.. note::

    * With more complex SQL statements, using JOINs for example, the result may be in a wrong order. In that case ``ORDER BY seq`` and ``ORDER BY path_seq`` will ensure that the path(s) is/are in the correct order.
    * The returned ``cost`` and ``agg_cost`` attributes are in the units of the ``cost`` variable.

In the current data, table ``ways`` does not have any information of one way or two way segments.
In this case, we are going to consider the information for routing a pedestrian.

* A pedestrian can go both ways on any segment, therefore the graph is `undirected`

The assignment of the vertices identifiers on the source and target columns may be different, the following exercises will use the results of this query.

If they go to vertex 49, the total time would be approximately: 62 + 123 + 99 = 284 minutes

If they go to vertex 60, the total time would be approximately 103 + 62 + 73 = 238 minutes

Exercise 5

.. rubric:: Many Pedestrians going to different destinations interested only on the aggregate cost.

* Pedestrian A: "I am in vertex 30 and I am meeting my friends at vertex 60 or at vertex 49."
* Pedestrian B: "I am in vertex 34 and I am meeting my friends at vertex 60 or at vertex 49."
* Pedestrian C: "I am in vertex 62 and I am meeting my friends at vertex 60 or at vertex 49."
* all: "we only want to know the Cost in hours"

.. rubric:: Problem description

* The pedestrians are located at vertex 30, 34, and 62
* The pedestrians want to go to this destinations: 60, 49
* The cost to be in hours.

* t = d/s
* 1m = 0.001m

.. _astar:

Shortest Path A*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A-Star algorithm is another well-known routing algorithm. It adds geographical information to source and target of each network link. This enables the routing query to prefer links which are closer to the target of the shortest path search.

.. rubric:: Prerequisites

For A-Star you need to prepare your network table and add latitude/longitude columns (``x1``, ``y1`` and ``x2``, ``y2``) and calculate their values.

.. code-block:: sql

    ALTER TABLE ways ADD COLUMN x1 double precision;
    ALTER TABLE ways ADD COLUMN y1 double precision;
    ALTER TABLE ways ADD COLUMN x2 double precision;
    ALTER TABLE ways ADD COLUMN y2 double precision;

    UPDATE ways SET x1 = ST_x(ST_PointN(the_geom, 1));
    UPDATE ways SET y1 = ST_y(ST_PointN(the_geom, 1));

    UPDATE ways SET x2 = ST_x(ST_PointN(the_geom, ST_NumPoints(the_geom)));
    UPDATE ways SET y2 = ST_y(ST_PointN(the_geom, ST_NumPoints(the_geom)));

.. Note::

    * A bug in a previous version of PostGIS didn't allow the use of ``ST_startpoint`` or ``ST_endpoint``.
    * From PostGIS 2.x ``ST_startpoint`` and ``ST_endpoint`` are only valid for ``LINESTRING`` geometry type and will fail with ``MULTILINESTING``.

    Therefor a slightly more difficult looking query is used.
    If the network data really contains multi-geomtery linestrings the query might give the wrong start and end point. But in general data has been imported as ``MULTILINESTING`` even if it only contains ``LINESTRING`` geometries.


.. rubric:: Description

Shortest Path A-Star function is very similar to the Dijkstra function, though it prefers links that are close to the target of the search. The heuristics of this search are predefined, so you need to recompile pgRouting if you want to make changes to the heuristic function itself.

Returns a set of ``pgr_costResult`` (seq, id1, id2, cost) rows, that make up a path.

.. code-block:: sql

    pgr_costResult[] pgr_astar(sql text, source integer, target integer, directed boolean, has_rcost boolean);


Description of the parameters can be found in `pgr_astar <http://docs.pgrouting.org/latest/en/src/dijkstra/doc/pgr_astar.html#description>`_

.. code-block:: sql

            SELECT gid AS id,
                 source::integer,
                 target::integer,
                 length::double precision AS cost,
                 x1, y1, x2, y2
                FROM ways',
            30, 60, false, false);


.. rubric:: Query result

.. code-block:: sql

     seq | node  |  edge  |        cost

     180 |    60 |     -1 |                   0
    (181 rows)

.. note::

    * The result of Dijkstra and A-Star might not be the same, because of the heuristic.
    * A-Star is theoretically faster than Dijkstra algorithm as the network size is getting larger.

There are many other functions available with the latest pgRouting release, most of them work in a similar way, and it would take too much time to mention them all in this workshop. For the complete list of pgRouting functions see the API documentation: http://docs.pgrouting.org/
