msgid "**osm2pgrouting** is a command line tool that allows to import OpenStreetMap data into a pgRouting database. It builds the routing network topology automatically and creates tables for feature types and road classes. osm2pgrouting was primarily written by Daniel Wendt and is currently hosted on the pgRouting project site: http://www.pgrouting.org/docs/tools/osm2pgrouting.html"

msgid "There are some limitations, especially regarding the network size. The current version of osm2pgrouting needs to load all data into memory, which makes it fast but also requires a lot or memory for large datasets. An alternative tool to osm2pgrouting without the network size limitation is **osm2po** (http://osm2po.de). It's available under \"Freeware License\"."
